This final project was a challenge. I worried about completion, but with hard effort and hours of coding, along with more hours on top of that with research, reading and sourcing, I was able to complete the project. This is Pidgey's Adventures. A Flappy Bird clone using sounds and graphics of the Pokemon Gold and Silver video games for the Game Boy Color. Pokemon Gold and Silver, spritesheets used and all sounds are copyright to Nintendo, Game Freak and the Pokemon Company. Flappy Bird copyright to Dong Nguyen. Spritesheets used thanks to the submitter Superjustinbros on The Spriters Resource.
