To try to put this relatively short...

I'm aiming to create a Flappy Bird Game. But I am using GameBoyColor Pokemon Gold/Silver sprites.

"Pidgey's Adventures"

This is the current progress so far of getting the spritesheat ready to start putting into a code.

This will have the ground going, buildings acting like the pipes, with trees and buildings slowly drifting in the background

So, similar to pacman, there are a list of things to do, one at a time. 

Get the canvas background,
then to follow by the city buildings, the grass, 
then the random pipe buildings, 
to the grass bottom.
There is also to insert the bird sprite, and have it rotate in its direction of lateral movement:
like beak pointed up when going up and beak pointing down when its going down. 

There is also the fact that there is 2 modes in flappy bird: day and night. I can create the different graphics easy, as mine will have day, night, and "party", and creating the ability to randomly (or in order) change between the 3 may be a challenge in itself. 

There is a lot of timing going on here and button reaction stuff. I do not know if I will be able to successfully do 
"multiple screens" perse, as I was just planning on using an HTML button to start it, but I'll figure that part out as I go. 

Its slightly fun to take notes of [a game](http://flappybird.io/) while you play (and fail) at it.
